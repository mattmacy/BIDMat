some pointers on building:
openjdk8 and gcc 4.8 or gcc 4.9 need to be installed

either Intel's MKL or openblas need to be installed
if MKL is installed it is assumed that icc is too



on Ubuntu 16
install liblapacke-dev openblas openjdk8 and gcc-4.9

and set
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
export GCC=g++-4.9
export CC=gcc-4.9
